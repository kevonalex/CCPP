The following project is a cryptocurrency price prediction program that uses an LSTM machine learning model trained on fundamental and technical analysis of a chosen cryptocurrency relative to the United States Dollar ($USD), and performs sentiment analysis on US news articles using BeautifulSoup. This data is collected and combined, before being input into the LSTM model for training. Once trained and tested to a sufficient degree, the estimated price of the cryptocurrency for X days following the latest price pulled from the Coinbase API is returned. The program also contains trading functionality through the Coinbase API, provided you have a Coinbase Pro account.
